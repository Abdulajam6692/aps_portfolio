      <h2>Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data Using 2D Kadane</h2>
      <p>This system focuses on identifying abnormal regions in a 2D grid of sensor data, where each cell represents a reading from a sensor node. Using an extended version of Kadane’s Algorithm adapted for 2D matrices, it efficiently scans all possible submatrices to find the one with the maximum aggregated anomaly value—typically high deviations from normal ranges. This helps in quickly isolating faulty areas, leakage zones, or thermal hotspots in smart devices, manufacturing units, or chip-based sensor networks. The solution leverages dynamic programming to ensure optimal performance even on large datasets, making it ideal for real-time monitoring systems.</p>

      <h2>AI-Powered Doubt Resolution System</h2>
      <p>This system is designed to intelligently resolve student doubts through natural language understanding. Built on top of a transformer-based NLP model, it accepts textual queries from students and generates context-aware answers, simulating a responsive tutor. The backend is powered by a Flask-based inference server using Hugging Face models, while the frontend is developed with React.js for smooth interaction. Doubts and their responses are stored systematically in a MySQL database, allowing teachers or admins to review and improve responses. This system enhances self-learning by providing instant clarification without relying on human intervention</p>

      <h2>Efficient Log Querying in Sensors Using Sparse Table</h2>
      <p>Applies immutable range queries for analytics on time-series logs using Sparse Table precomputation.
        enable fast and efficient range queries on sensor log data. Ideal for immutable datasets, it precomputes answers for overlapping intervals, allowing quick retrieval of minimum or maximum values over any range. This greatly optimizes performance in systems where sensor data is read frequently but rarely updated, such as in real-time monitoring or diagnostics.

      <h2>Efficient Spatial Querying with KD Tree for Sensor Data

</h2>
      <p>Enables multi-dimensional spatial querying for sensor/geolocation systems via KD Tree.
        This project utilizes a KD Tree (K-Dimensional Tree) to organize spatial sensor data for rapid nearest neighbor and range queries. By recursively partitioning the data space, the KD Tree supports efficient retrieval of relevant sensor nodes based on location, which is crucial in applications such as environmental sensing, robotics navigation, and real-time tracking systems.

      <h2>PageRank-Based Network Importance</h2>
      <p>PageRank assigns a numerical weight to each page, representing its relative importance within the network. This is calculated through an iterative process where the rank of a page depends on the ranks of pages linking to it, adjusted by the number of outbound links they have. Beyond web search, PageRank has been applied in various fields like social network analysis, recommendation systems, and critical dependency analysis in complex systems, due to its ability to identify influential nodes within interconnected data.</p>
